/*
 Spend a gift card on food items for a meal at a restaurant

Constraints/Hints:
- must use 100% of the gift card value
- any item can be purchased an unlimited number of times

Inputs:
- $0 < all money values <= $1,000
- 1 <= menu size <= 100
- menu names/prices are unique to each other


Part One:

- write a method that processes a single gift card amount at a time
- return an array/list of strings indicating the menu item names which spend 100% of the gift card
- return an empty array/list if you cannot find an answer.
- more than one answer might be possible, stop and return the FIRST one you find

Example:
    menu:
    $15 full dinner
    $4 sandwich
    $3 milkshake

purchase_food(10.00)
    ... would return ['sandwich', 'milkshake', 'milkshake']
purchase_food(5.00)
    ... would return []
